// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain

    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.
